Further, some cells rely on variables assigned by earlier cells.  If you execute these cells out of order, or if you execute the same cell twice, then you may end up changing the value of the variables.  To correct this, click on \"Cell\" at the top and execute \"run all above\" or \"run all\".  You can also reset all cells by clicking \"Cell -> All Output -> Clear\"\n",
